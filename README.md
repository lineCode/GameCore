## BFL_CollisionQueries.h
All collision queries are generic to both line traces and shape sweeps.

### Exit hit scene casting
Exit hits are useful in cases where you need the other side of the geometry that was hit. We achieve this by performing a second scene cast in the opposite direction. This can get expensive as your query length is effectively doubling. To mitigate this, a built-in optimization is provided to minimize the backward query length down to its shortest guaranteed working length.

### Penetration scene casting
Penetration through blocking hits is useful for when you are querying with a trace channel but do not want to be stopped by the trace channel\'s blocking hits. This is a good way to observe what types of hit responses are within your query\'s area.
Given a situation where you need a scene cast that goes through walls (e.g. a bullet), you may make a trace channel that overlaps walls. However, if you want to keep the distinction between physical walls and trigger boxes, for example, getting overlap responses for both won\'t help. Instead, you want an overlap response for the trigger box and a blocking response for the wall. This penetration feature makes this distinction possible while penetrating through the blocking hits.


## BFL_StrengthCollisionQueries.h
A collection of specialized scene casts that rely on strength to keep it traveling. These are given an initial strength and lose strength from provided strength nerfs. The scene cast is stopped the moment its strength runs out.

### Strength
Strength can be nerfed per cm according to the per cm nerf stack.
Strength can be nerfed on a ricochet hit.
- Penetrations - Penetrations nerf the strength via the per cm nerf stack - adding to it on entrance and removing from it on exit.
- Ricochets - Ricochets nerf the strength in a one-off fashion.
